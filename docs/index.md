## Motivation

In the age of remote work and AI, career transitioning through bootcamp programs
has become a popular choice for many. However, the transition from bootcamp to
first job is often a difficult one. Bootcamp graduates often find themselves in
a difficult position after graduation. They are competing with other graduates
from classical routes and bootcamps, and often find themselves at a disadvantage.

This project aims to help bridge the gap by providing a set of essential guides
to help graduates take their captstone projects to the next level, while allowing
the community to contribute guides to provide their own insights and experiences.
