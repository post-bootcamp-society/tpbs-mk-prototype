However, the transition from bootcamp to first job is often a difficult one. Bootcamp graduates often find themselves in a difficult position after graduation. They are competing with other graduates from classical routes and bootcamps, and often find themselves at a disadvantage.</p> <p>This project aims to help bridge the gap by providing a set of essential guides to help graduates take their captstone projects to the next level, while allowing the community to contribute guides to provide their own insights and experiences.</p>"},{"location":"#core-team","title":"Core Team","text":"<ul> <li>Ian Yu</li> </ul>"},{"location":"community/ianyu93/profile/","title":"Ian Yu","text":""},{"location":"community/ianyu93/profile/#background","title":"Background","text":"<p>I graduated from BrainStation's Data Science program in 2020.</p>"},{"location":"community/ianyu93/profile/#philosophy","title":"Philosophy","text":"<p>There are three pillars for competency after graduation:</p> <ul> <li>Applied Technical Skills: Bootcamp graduates are exposed to a variety of tools and techniques used today, which is an advantage they have over a computer science graduate. Typically, it is expected for CS graduates to learn these skills on the job, so the \"time to competency\" can be shorter for bootcamp graduates.</li> <li>Theoretical Knowledge: That said, bootcamp graduates lack the theoretical understanding of computer science concepts that CS graduates spent years to hone on. It is an area that bootcamp graduates need to catch up on, but not spent too much of their time on initially.</li> <li>Past Experience: Bootcamp graduates come from a variety of background. These experiences are valuable, even if they are not directly related to the field. Straightforward ones like statistical skills and domain knowledge are valuable. Even if you worked in retail, there are soft transferable skills that you can market.</li> </ul> <p>I suggest bootcamp graduates prioritize strategizing their marketability based on past experiences and strengths, then focus on acquiring essential applied technical skills without overdoing it. Finally, dedicate time to catching up on basic theoretical knowledge, making sure to watch out for diminishing returns in what you do and optimize every moment spent.</p> <pre><code>graph TD\n    A[Bootcamp Graduation] --&gt; B[Applied Technical Skills]\n    A --&gt; C[Theoretical Knowledge]\n    A --&gt; D[Past Experience]\n    B --&gt; E[Marketability Based on Existing Skills and Experience]\n    C --&gt; E\n    D --&gt; E[Marketability Based on Existing Skills and Experience]\n    E --&gt; F[Train Up On Applied Technical Skills Sufficient to Do the Job]\n    F --&gt; G[Catch Up on Theoretical Knowledge to Converse in the Lingo]</code></pre>"},{"location":"core/data-science/","title":"Data Science","text":""},{"location":"core/data-science/#outline-wip","title":"Outline (WIP)","text":"<ul> <li>Some concepts that would be hepful, like APIs, leaving Notebook environment, etc.</li> <li>Some good practices for a data science projects</li> <li>Streamlit or Huggingface with Docker for deployment</li> </ul>"}]}
